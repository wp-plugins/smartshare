Include social share buttons in your template, that doesn't cause additional requests, javascript, css-files or iframes.
Just performance for your site.

== Description ==

Common methods to embed social sharing buttons use JavasSript or iframes and cause significant loading sizes and delays through
additional JavaScript, CSS, HTTP requests and DNS requests.

This plugin provides three simple template tags (PHP calls) to include plain links to share your posts or pages to Twitter,
Facebook and Google +1 without these perfomance disadvantages.

The plugin provides these performance/privacy advantages:
1. No addional HTTP requests
2. No addional DNS requests
3. No external ressources required (like JavaScript or CSS from the social network sites)
4. No addional JavaScript (just an inline eventhandler to open a popup if you want)
5. No addional CSS
6. No iframes (which would load a complete external site including a lot of HTTP & DNS requests, external ressources, etc.)
7. No privacy issues (iframes or JavaScript buttons read the login-cookies of the social network sites and allow them to trace the users surf behavior)
8. Just plain HTML links (you can link plain text or HTML like images)

You can customize the share links with your own HTML. For example you can build buttons instead of text links. There are two
types of buttons predefined (small and big ones) you can use easily.
Furthermore there are some parameters to modify the created links (add CSS classes, open links in popup, etc.). 

If you have any suggestion to improve this plugin or if want to translate it to other languages, please
let me know or post a comment on my site.
